# Code of Conduct

Please be kind and respectful when opening issues and PRs. It's just a random blog written by some random person on the internet, no need to get so worked up about it. That being said, if I sense that a discussion is getting too heated, out of hand or off-topic, I will close it. Whether you like it or not.

## Issues

### Suggesting ideas
If you're suggesting ideas for me to write about, please try to provide some links that can help better explain the topic. This'll make it easier for me to research and write about whatever topic you wanted me to write about.

I also may choose to not write about a topic. This could be for many reasons, such as not being able to understand the topic well enough, not finding it interesting enough, not finding enough sources to write a proper post, etc. Whatever the reason, I will try my best to inform you and close the issue. If I do so, it's not personal, and this is my blog and **I'll write about what I want to write about**. I'll try to be polite about it, and I hope you will too.

If I do choose to write about your topic, you should keep in mind that it may take me a while to get to it. I'm not always on my computer, and this isn't my main priority at the moment. And yes, sometimes I'm procrastinating. I might also ask you for help or more links and sources to make it easier for me to understand your topic, and hence write about it. You don't _have_ to respond, and I (probably) won't stop writing about your idea if you don't, but I hope you do. It makes my work a lot easier, and you'll get your post quicker. It's a win-win!

### Correcting errors
If you're correcting an error I made, provide links to back up your claims. I will not accept corrections without any sources to back them up. And don't be rude or cocky about it if you do find an error. I'm willing to accept my mistakes, but this doesn't mean I'm gonna accept misbehavior or negativity like that.

### Other bugs
If you've found a bug in the website, let me know what and where it is. A screenshot would be helpful too. Before you do submit the issue, make sure that you're using the latest versions of both your OS and browser, and test that the bug shows up even after updating. This would seriously help clearing up unnecessary issues that shouldn't have been opened in the first place, and would save both of our time.

## Pull Requests

If you're opening a PR, **please test it locally first** using the instructions in the [README](../README.md), before you open it. I don't have an automated way to test if your PR builds, and if it ends up failing on my device because of a change you've made, I will be most displeased.

You may add any `markdown-it` packages from NPM for formatting purposes or whatever else, but let me know that in your PR so that I can add it to my version too before testing. Also, make sure both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` reflect your additions or changes before submitting. It should do this automatically, but it doesn't hurt to check.

Lastly, similar to issues, don't be rude or cocky or toxic to me or anyone else here. Let's all have calm discussions and a good time overall.

TL;DR: Don't be a meanie and we'll all be happy.
