## Humble beginnings 

Google had its [humble beginnings](https://about.google/our-story/) in 1995 as a research project by Stanford University students Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan. While Hassan left before the company was officially founded, the other two remained, and went on to become owners of one of the [largest companies](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-google-worth/) in the world.

Now, the company that started out as a simple search engine controls the daily lives of millions of people around the world, with their [largest product](https://sg.oberlo.com/statistics/search-engine-market-share) being Google Search. It's so popular that "Googling" has become [synonymous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/google) with searching the web.
