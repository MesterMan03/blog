    details: I'm just a kid on the internet who's interested in the most unusual and bizarre things. I'll have a conversation about nearly any topic you bring up, even if I know absolutely nothing about it. I'm ambiverted, which means I'm somewhere between shy and social, so feel free to start up a conversation with me, and I'll be sure to respond (usually almost immediately)! I'm also a huge tech nerd and a privacy advocate, though I'm not the most knowledgeable at either. I do try my best though. I've done months of research on topics such as digital privacy and security, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it's more than most people have done.

# The Blog of Random

A blog about the most random things you can think of, brought to you by the most interesting boring person you've ever met

## About me

I'm just a kid on the internet who's interested in the most unusual and bizarre things. I'll have a conversation about nearly any topic you bring up, even if I know absolutely nothing about it. I'm ambiverted, which means I'm somewhere between shy and social, so feel free to start up a conversation with me, and I'll be sure to respond (usually almost immediately)!

I'm also a huge tech nerd and a privacy advocate, though I'm not the most knowledgeable at either. I do try my best though. I've done months of research on topics such as digital privacy and security, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it's more than most people have done.

Anyway, pleasant to make your acquaintance, enjoy the blog!

:D
