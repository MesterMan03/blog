  - title: About this blog
    details: This blog is about pretty much any topic I find interesting at the moment. I've written about historical topics, math stuff, tech, and more. I'd love ideas for things to write about. You can recommend them at my GitHub by opening an issue, or contact me on Matrix at @whatanerd:envs.net. I don't have a strict upload schedule, but on average I post about once a month, though don't quote me on that (I've gone like 3 months without posting before.). I try to write as frequently as I can, but I get distracted easily and I procrastinate a lot, so you might go a few weeks or sometimes months without any new posts, so sorry about that.

  - title: How can I keep up with updates/new posts?
    details: Eventually I plan to set up an RSS feed on a website completely designed by me, but for now I'm using VitePress and it doesn't support RSS/Atom feeds. Another option would be to set up a newsletter type thing, but I don't want to give out my real email address to the newsletter provider, and I don't want you to either, so that's not an option that's too attractive for me at the moment. One option is to subscribe to the GitHub Releases Atom feed for this, since I'll create a new release when I make a new post or a big change / set of changes to the website.
