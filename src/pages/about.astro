            <h1>About this blog</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
                This blog is about pretty much any topic I find interesting at
                the moment. I've written about historical topics, math stuff,
                tech, and more. I'd love ideas for things to write about. You
                can recommend them at my GitHub by opening an issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't have a strict upload schedule, but on average I post
                about once a month, though don't quote me on that (I've gone
                like 3 months without posting before.). I try to write as
                frequently as I can, but I get distracted easily and I
                procrastinate a lot, so you might go a few weeks or sometimes
                months without any new posts, so sorry about that.
            </p>

            <h2>How can I keep up with updates/new posts?</h2>
            <p>
                You can subscribe to the <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.
                Another option is to subscribe to the GitHub Releases Atom feed
                for this, since I'll create a new release when I make a new post
                or a big change / set of changes to the website.
            </p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not an expert in any of the things I talk about in this
                blog. I'm just someone who likes to read about the most random
                and obscure things I can think of, not a professional historian
                or cybersecurity researcher. A lot of the information I get
                comes from the internet, and I think we all know how trustworthy
                and reliable that is. Of course, I do my best to get info from
                trustworthy sources, but they can get stuff wrong too. If you do
                find something wrong with the content of my blog, or really any
                problem in general, <a
                    href="https://github.com/noClaps/blog/issues/new/choose"
                    >open an issue</a
                >!
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also the chance that I don't have the most up-to-date
                information in my content. This can be because my sources were
                old, or I haven't bothered to update the content, or I simply
                don't know that its outdated. In any case, if you're using the
                content of my blog as a reference for something (first of all,
                why?), make sure that you're cross-checking all the information
                and ensuring that it's all up-to-date. I do not take
                responsibility for your bad grades, or anything else that
                happens because of incorrect or outdated content in my blog.
