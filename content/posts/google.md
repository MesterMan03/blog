## Humble beginnings 

Google had its [humble beginnings](https://about.google/our-story/) in 1995 as a research project by Stanford University students Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan. While Hassan left before the company was officially founded, the other two remained, and went on to become owners of one of the [largest companies](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-google-worth/) in the world.

Now, the company that started out as a simple search engine controls the daily lives of millions of people around the world, with their [largest product](https://sg.oberlo.com/statistics/search-engine-market-share) being Google Search. It's so popular that "Googling" has become [synonymous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/google) with searching the web. Other than the search engine, Google's other products are also widely used, such as [Google Drive](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/google-drive), [Gmail](https://techjury.net/blog/gmail-statistics/), [Google Maps](https://webtribunal.net/blog/google-map-statistics/), etc. However, Google's most popular products are [Android](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share) and [Chrome](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share).

## Billionaires

[Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.) is the current parent company of Google and its former subsidiaries, and fills the position that Google used to fill until [October 2015](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/02/google-becomes-alphabet/). Alphabet was the [3<sup>rd</sup>-largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_technology_companies_by_revenue#2021_list) tech company (by revenue) in the world in 2021, only behind Apple and Samsung, beating out other huge companies like Microsoft and Facebook/Meta. That's impressive, but where do they get so much money, when most of Google's products are free for people to use?

### Subsidiaries

Alphabet and Google own [a _lot_ of companies](https://www.kamilfranek.com/what-companies-alphabet-google-owns/). Here's a small list of companies that they own:

#### Alphabet
- [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)
- [Waymo (self-driving cars)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo)
- [Verily (study of life sciences)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verily)
- [X (research and development)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Development)
    - [Loon (provide internet access to rural areas)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon_LLC)
    - [Wing (drone-based delivery)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_(company))

#### Google
- [YouTube (video hosting)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube)
- [Waze (satellite navigation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze)
- [DoubleClick (ads)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleClick)
- [Google Nest (IoT devices)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest)
- [Google Fiber (Internet access provider)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fiber)

Combining revenue from all of these companies, Alphabet earned over [$250 billion](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22912196/google-alphabet-200-billion-annual-revenue-youtube-pixel-search) in 2021.

### Minor sources
Google also has other, minor sources of income, such as:
- [Google One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_One)
- [YouTube Premium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Premium)
- Hardware devices
    - [Pixel devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel)
    - [Fitbit fitness trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitbit)
    - [Google Nest smart home devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest)

However, these contribute to a very small percentage of Google's total income.

## Advertising and data collection
This is by far the most profitable business for Google, earning over [$200 billion in 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/) from ads alone. Seeing as their total revenue for 2021 was just over $250 billion, it's clear how important advertising has been for Google. However, Google's advertising strategy isn't as straightforward as people believe it to be.

### Myth: Google sells user data
[This is actually false.](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Google-sell-the-personal-data-to-some-agency) Considering how valuable data is, especially in this day and age, it wouldn't make sense for Google to simply give it away for a (relatively) small amount of money. Instead, Google employs a far more complex and intelligent strategy, which is the reason they're the advertising kings.

### Ad spots and RTB
Let's say you have a website that you own, `grandmascooking.com`, and you want to earn money from the website. There are a few ways you can do this. Your first option is to create a paywall to enter and use the site, including one-time payments, a subscription model, etc. However, this would significantly limit the number of users your your site gets, and there are services like [12ft](https://12ft.io/) that are made specifically to bypass subscriptions.

Your other option is to have ads on your website, and earn revenue from that. This is generally a much more profitable option, since you'll get more users and most people are generally used to seeing ads on the internet, even if they're not happy about it. Most websites, both big and small, usually opt for this.

In order to display ads on your website, you set up certain areas where ads can be displayed, which I'll call ad spots. You go to [Google Adsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AdSense), and you tell them that you want to display ads on your website. Google will then generate some code, which you can copy onto your website, and _voil√†_! You now have ads shown on your website.

Now, whenever Google sees that someone has visited your website, they pull up that person's profile to see their interests. Say I've just visited your website and Google sees that I have an interest in watches. They'll go to the companies that want to advertise their products, like Tissot or Omega, and tell them, "Hey we've got a person who may be interested in your stuff". The companies then start "bidding" (RTB) for the ad spot to show me an advertisement for whatever product they have, and Google will select the highest bid depending on how much the company paid for it and how likely I am to click on it.

All of this is automated, obviously. It's a bunch of bots bidding against other bots, and an [algorithm](https://searchengineland.com/new-adwords-ad-ranking-formula-what-does-it-mean-174946) to select the most optimal advertisement to show to users.

This is only one of the many ways that Google can earn money from ads. There's also search engine advertisements, YouTube ads, in-app advertisements, etc.

### Data collection
Although Google doesn't sell your data, this doesn't mean they don't collect it. They collect [a _lot_ of data](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US#infocollect), such as your browsing history, app usage, contacts, photos, name, search data, and so much more.

If you trust Google with this data, then great! Google has implemented [extensive security measures](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US#infosecurity) to keep your personal information safe from anyone else, malicious or otherwise. [Nothing's 100% secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches), but Google is definitely one of the closest.

However, if you don't trust Google, then this can be a huge issue. They hold a immense amount of data on everyone that is currently using and has previously used their services. While it is anonymised and encrypted, [encryption can be broken](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/03/encryption-101-how-to-break-encryption/) and [information can be de-anonymised](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/researchers-spotlight-the-lie-of-anonymous-data/). This is a huge privacy issue, and [Google's paid the price for it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-google-hit-with-eur50-million-fine-by-french-data-protection-watchdog/).

### Monopoly
If you think back to 2001, you may recall [_United States v. Microsoft Corp._](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.), which was an antitrust law case against Microsoft for illegally maintaining a monopoly. At the time, Internet Explorer had an approximately 90% share in the global web browser market, eventually peaking at 96% in 2002.

Today, Microsoft no longer holds that position in browsers. Chrome is now the leader in browsers, with a [65% market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) (as of June 2022). Chrome is built on the open source [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) project, which is mainly developed by Google. Other companies also use Chromium as their base to build their own browsers, such as [Brave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)), [Microsoft Edge](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge/blob/14b03579d54acc5c294f846ad23f688a7eb8c124/README.md), [Opera](https://dev.opera.com/blog/a-first-peek-at-opera-15-for-computers/), [Samsung Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Internet), [Vivaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivaldi_(web_browser)), [Yandex Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex_Browser), etc. However, any changes Google makes to Chromium will generally be followed by these browsers. This gives Google a lot of power over the internet.

On top of that, Google Search has a [92% share](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share) in the search engine market, with no one to contest them. While there are privacy-friendly options, like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/), [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) and more, most people don't know they exist. And those that do, don't find the results good enough to use.

{{<quote "My Experience">}}
I've used all 3 of the search engines listed above, and the only one that has worked consistently well for me has been Brave Search. DuckDuckGo is basically Bing without the tracking, and Bing has never given me good results.

While Startpage has decent results (they use Google Search for their results), it doesn't work well if you're using Tor or a VPN, and they show their own ads which, while privacy-friendly, are annoying. Other than that, for most people, Startpage is the closest to Google you can get.

I do recommend Brave Search, however. They use their own search index for results, and it's worked flawlessly for ~95% of my searches. If you like Brave Search, you can set it as the [default search engine](https://search.brave.com/default) in your browser.

**I am not affiliated with any of these companies.** This recommendation is purely based on personal experience.

Google also makes Android, which is used by [over 70% of all mobile devices](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile), most of which are also using Google Play Services and Google's apps.

Google has tried to use this monopolistic position to control the internet, and have been [sued for it](https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuits-explainer/), multiple times.

## Heroes
Now, hearing all of that, you may be led to believe that Google isn't the best of companies, or even the worst. That's a completely valid opinion to have. That's where the "Evil" part of the title comes in. However, they aren't completely horrible, and are oftentimes misrepresented as being the worst company of all time.

### Open source connoisseurs
Google has been very [involved](https://opensource.google/projects) with the open source community, far more than any other companies of Big Tech. From [Android](https://source.android.com/), [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git), [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular), [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang), [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter), [Golang](https://go.googlesource.com/go), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes), and more, Google has always been very supportive of the open source philosophy. Even their upcoming OS, [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/), is [open source](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/get_fuchsia_source).

This shows that Google is inclusive of the developer community as a whole, not just their own employees. Google open sourcing their work is what has allowed us to get amazing projects such as [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/),
