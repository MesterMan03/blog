This blog is about pretty much any topic I find interesting at the moment. I've written about historical topics, math stuff, tech, and more. I'd love ideas for things to write about. You can recommend them at my GitHub by opening an issue.

I don't have a strict upload schedule, but on average I post about once a month, though don't quote me on that (I've gone like 3 months without posting before.). I try to write as frequently as I can, but I get distracted easily and I procrastinate a lot, so you might go a few weeks or sometimes months without any new posts, so sorry about that.

## How can I keep up with updates/new posts?
You can subscribe to the [RSS feed](/index.xml). Another option is to subscribe to the GitHub Releases Atom feed for this, since I'll create a new release when I make a new post or a big change / set of changes to the website.

A popular method is to set up a newsletter type thing, but I don't want to give out my real email address to the newsletter provider, and I don't want you to either, so that's not an option that's too attractive for me at the moment.

## Disclaimer
I'm not an expert in any of the things I talk about in this blog. I'm just someone who likes to read about the most random and obscure things I can think of, not a professional historian or cybersecurity researcher. A lot of the information I get comes from the internet, and I think we all know how trustworthy and reliable that is. Of course, I do my best to get info from trustworthy sources, but they can get stuff wrong too. If you do find something wrong with the content of my blog, or really any problem in general, [open an issue](https://github.com/noClaps/blog/issues/new/choose)!

There is also the chance that I don't have the most up-to-date information in my content. This can be because my sources were old, or I haven't bothered to update the content, or I simply don't know that its outdated. In any case, if you're using the content of my blog as a reference for something (first of all, why?), make sure that you're cross-checking all the information and ensuring that it's all up-to-date. I do not take responsibility for your bad grades, or anything else that happens because of incorrect or outdated content in my blog.
